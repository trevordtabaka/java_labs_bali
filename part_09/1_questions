1) What is the difference between a byte stream and a character stream?
byte streams read and write data 8 bits at a time and character streams 16 bits at a time

2) List at least 3 examples of byte stream classes?
FileInputStream
FilterInputStream
BufferedInputStream

3) List at least 3 examples of character stream classes?
InputStreamReader
OutputStreamWriter
BufferedWriter

4) What is try-with-resources? Why is it super cool?
It is another type of try catch statement that specifies a resource you are going to try and use.
 It is cool because it automatically closes the connection afterwards. You dont use the close() functions.

5) Demonstrate a try-wth-resources block:
try(InputStreamReader input = new InputSteam(pathToFileAndName);
    OutputStreamReader out = new OutputSteam(pathToFileAndName)){
    do{
        stream = input.read();
        if(stream!= -1){
            out.write(stream);
        }
    }while(stream != -1);
}

6) What does the read() method on the FileInputStream class return?
an int

7) What is the documentation above of the FileInputStream class header say? (hint: inside /** ... */)
     * Creates a FileInputStream by
     * opening a connection to an actual file,
     * the file named by the path name
     * in the file system.  A new FileDescriptor
     * object is created to represent this file
     * connection.
     *
     * First, if there is a security
     * manager, its checkRead method
     * is called with the name argument
     * as its argument.
     *
     * If the named file does not exist, is a directory rather than a regular
     * file, or for some other reason cannot be opened for reading then a
     * FileNotFoundException is thrown.

8) Is a DataOutputStream used for bytes or characters?
bytes

9) What is a BufferedReader?
A buffered input character stream

10) Why does a BufferedReader require an InputStreamReader as an argument?
the InputStreamReader takes in the bytes from an InputStream and converts them to characters

11) What does the InputStreamReader dp with it's byte stream argument?
converts it to character

12) What is the difference between the read() and readLine() on BufferedReader?
read returns bytes of data readLine() will return strings

13) Demonstrate instantiating a BufferedReader that will read a file called "yucatan_cenotes.txt"
BufferedReader buffRead = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader("yucatan_cenotes"));
