Answer the following questions:

1) What is an array?
A collection of variables of the same type, referred to by a common name

2) What the code required to create (instantiate) a String array with size 10 named "cats"?
String[] cats = new String[10];

3) What is a multidimensional array?
An array of arrays essentially. ie columns and rows.

4) What is the code required to create (instantiate) a 2-dimensional int array that is 6 high and 6 wide named "scores"?
int[][] scores = new  int[6][6];

5) Using code, how do you retrieve a String that is the 10th item in a traditional array named dogs?
String x = dogs[9];

6) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?
When you try to retrieve an index of an array that doesnt exist

7) Using one line of code, demonstrate how to retrieve the second to the last item from a int array.
int item = myArray[myArray.length-2];

8) What is the maximum allowable size of an array in Java?
2^31-1 = 2147483647, which is Integer.MAX_VALUE. but in practical usage might be a few less.

9) What is a bubble sort?
A sorting operation that goes through an array and moves smaller values to one end and larger ones to the other.

10) How does a bubble sort work?
It repeatedly compares and can exchange adjacent elements in the array.

11) When might you use an irregular array? What is a good example of an irregular array?
When you dont know exactly the length that will be needed for one of the array of arrays.
If you know there will be 10 bus trips but you do not know how many passengers will be on each trip.

12) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a for loop.

int[] myArray = new int[10];
for(int i = 0; i<myArray.length; i++){
    sout(myArray[i]);
}

13) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a while loop.
        int[] myArray = new int[10];
        int count = 0;
        while(count<myArray.length){
            System.out.println(count +" " + myArray[count]);
            count++;
        }
14) What is a queue?
A list data structure that is accessed in a first in first out manner

15) What are the two primary operations that a queue performs?
put and get

16) What is a stack?
A list data structure that is accesses in a first in last out manner

17) What differentiates stacks and queues?
stack is FILO and queue is FIFO

18) When would you use an enhanced for loop?
When you know you just need to loop through a collection from beginning to end

19) What is "The Collections Framework"? What classes does it include?
The Collections Framework are the classes that implement different data structures, like lists, vectors,etc.

20) How do you iterate over a two-dimensional array? Demonstrate using psuedo code.
//make a for loop which loops over each row
//nest a for loop in the previous to iterate through each element in the given row


21) What is a String?
a set of chars enclosed by double quotes


22) What are a few common methods for operating on Strings?
length(), chatAt(), indexOf()
23) What does "Strings are immutable" mean?
You can not change their values after instantiating

24) Using the CLI, how do you invoke a Java application and provide two parameters to the main method?
1. you have to move to the directory of the .java file that contains the main method
2. compile using javac
3. invoke the .class file with java command followed by the two parameters.

java myClass.class param1 param2
