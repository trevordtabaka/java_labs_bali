1) What is Java inheritance?
it is a pillar of java oop that allows you to make a hierarchical classification of objects
2) How does inheritance work?
It works by using the concept of parent classes and making sub classes of those called the child classes.
The child classes can inhererit characteristics of the parent class
3) What are some advantages that inheritance provides?
You can create superclasses that define a general set of characteristics for a set of subclasses. Allows you to organize and reuse your code better
4) What does the "super" keyword do?
It declares that the object calling the following is a subclass of the it and you are using the superclasses member.

5) In what order are constructors called when there are multiple subclasses?
The one at the top of the hierarchy is the first constructor that gets fully executed.

6) What does it mean when a method is overridden?
It means that the subclass has created a method that is the same name as the superclasses and will replace the super classes method

7) How do overridden methods support polymorphism?
they allow your code to be more dynamic. Dynamic method dispatch.

8) What is the difference between an overloaded method and an overridden method?
overloading is more than one method of the same name in a single class but overriding is same method names between super and subclasses

9) What is dynamic method dispatch?
It is resolved at run time instead of compile time. So you could still use the superclasses method

10) What does the "final" keyword do?
it allows a superclass to make a method and not allow any other subclass to override it

11) Are classes in Java are a subclass of what super class?
Object
